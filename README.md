# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was created whilst following [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) curriculum.

The Etch-a-Sketch pad generates by default as a 16x16 grid of random colored squares. 

Click and drag to draw on the pad, set size with the range input and the button, or clear with the clear button.
