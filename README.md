# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was created whilst following [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) curriculum.

The Etch-a-Sketch pad generates by default as a 16x16 grid of random colored squares. Click the handy-dandy 'Click me' button to
regenerate the grid in any size up to 100x100 (that's 10,000 squares!). 

Moving your cursor across the pad will slowly increase the opacity of each square it hits, until filled.
